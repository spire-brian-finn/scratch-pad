/*
note from Jeff:
oof. Â  variable length arrays (VLAs) were included in C99 but not in C++ (as of at least c++14, not clear on more recent but it seems still not) and the topic seems to have been hotly debated for a while. Â However, gcc and clang do support them, but there's also a warning that can be enabled -Werror=vla
